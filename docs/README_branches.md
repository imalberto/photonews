pure-react:
- Y.router and React only. No Y.App, similar to the Backbone examples out there.

  integrate reactjs with YAF


## Deleted Branches

react:
- test branch based off caridy/photonews#react branch to integrate
  locator-react#react with the application

react2:
- merging clarle/photonews#multi-model branch back into my working branch and
  supporting reactjs
